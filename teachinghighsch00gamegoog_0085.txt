FIRST-YEAR LATIN 71

catch your usage quite as well as they will if you say much
about it. By this indirection you will accomplish your pur-
pose in time. Reciting in concert, parading, verseS, songS,
and the like will work out your problems in pronunciation.

Accent.-—A satisfactory text should not present the
tasks too rapidly. The reasons for accent might well be
held back for some weekS, but the early lessons should show
every new word properly accented. Later, when the rules
for accent are given, you have the basis already laid for
fixing the rules definitely in the pupils' minds. As sug-
gested in the matter of pronunciation, accent your own
words correctly and be patient with the class. Things will
come out all- right 1n good time.

Quantity. —The value of vowels must be explained, and,
since nearly all the texts have the long vowels marked,
it is easy to present this topic. The bearing of the vowels
on pronunciation and accent is easily understood.

The question of requiring all the long vowels to be
marked in all written exercises is one that requires attention.
For some years a majority of the best schools in this country
have greatly stressed the marking of long voweIS, requiring
this to be done in all written parading, exerciseS, etc.
This has not proved to be a paying task‚ its value falling
decidedly· short of the outlay in time, effort, and nervous
strain. If the choice is between so much of it and none
at all, take the latter. Latin teaching has become so
cluttered up with extra work that has little to do with
learning the language that it is necessary to choose some
vital parts and let the rest g0. Pupils do not need a knowl-
edge of quantities until they reach Vergil; certainly it is
not a serious need, and when they do need this information
they can get it in a very short time.
