120 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

Vocational training in this country is unfortunately
burdened and there is danger that a good cause may be
permanently damaged in consequence, for the following
reasons: (1) All the faddists who· have been chasing
fantasies' for a' generation have taken up the slogan of
vocational training. With sober-minded people, their
advocacy arouses prejudice against any cause they may
espouse. (2) These faddists attack other subjectS, Latin
in particular, and thus antagonize a great many people
unnecessarily. People who have studied Latin have made
good citizens and are as successful in making a living as
the vocationist could wish. (3) The advocates of voca-
tional training make a mistake in forcing it upon the ordi-
nary schOOIS, rather than establishing special schools for

this purpose, wherever students are available in sufficiently .

Ι large numbers. If· vocational training is to become effec-
’ tive in the sense of trade schOOIS‚ separate schools are abso--
lutely necessary. If our present schools ¹become efficient
vocational schOOIS, they will cease to be of value for any
other purpose. General education or special training will
fail in the experiment, possibly both. (4) The main point
is well stated by Dean Bagley: “Most of those who advo-
cate early vocational differentiation are not' thinking of
their own children. Of course a broad and liberal training
is presupposed for them. These opportunities for early ·
vocational choices are for other people’s children.''1

You will do the right thing if you help along the cause
of vocational training wherever possible, regardless of the
lack of good judgment shown by some of those who try
