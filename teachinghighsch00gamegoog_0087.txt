F IRST-YEAR LATIN 73

interesting material down to pupils even of this grade.
It adds to their interest and helps them to bear up under the
burden and drudgery of forms and constructions. Do not
overstress this feature, but give it some time. This subject
is treated more fully elsewhere.

Your main task.—You are expected to teach your class
the forms and simplet constructions during this year.
If you· fail in this, your work is defective. Make your
hours and classroom pleasant and attractive, plan out some
relaxation‚ but use this as a means to an end—good hard,
honest work by the class Let it be understood that the
task must' be done, that the forms and constructions must
be learned above all else. Keep this to the front and
results will come.

Who should be .promoted?—-After you have done your
best to do the work expected of you, you may at the year's
close find some who simply cannot go on to the next year's
work. . You will have to decide promotions on the merits
of individual cases, of course. If a pupil knows the forms
and constructions well, even though he may be weak in
his translations, it is generally safe to move him up. Some
will prefer to go over the book again. ’ It is not wise to
hold a pupil to the first-year text until he is thoroughly
tired and sick of it. Sometimes a trial of second-year
work will convince him of his weakness and send him back
to more earnest effort in first-year work. On the whole,
the question of promotionis simply that of whether the boy
or girl can d'o the next year's work. This depends on the
second year's task. If you go directly to Caesar, the num-
ber promoted must be carefully guarded. If you use the
more sensible, easy Latin for awhile, you can promote with
less hesitation those who are fairly well able to do the work.
