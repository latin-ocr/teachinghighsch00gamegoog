LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION 5

and nutrition of mind which flows from the study of the origin andx
history of wordS. Latin enables us to revivify our own tongue for
ourselveS. Nay, we are studying our own language in much of its
syntactical mould also, as may be seen by reading our early prose
writerS, and even those of the eighteenth century.

6. It follows from the preceding reason that in studying Latin
we are brought face to face with modern conceptions as to moral
dutieS, social relationS‚ and legal obligations in their origins‚ and that
we thus undergo a kind of unconscious philosophical training suited
to the as yet immature mind, and moulding its conceptions from the
foundation. Dr. W. T. HarriS, Education Commissioner for the
United StateS, says: “One may say that of a hundred boyS‚ fifty
of whom had studied Latin for a period of six monthS, while the other
fifty had not 'studied Latin at all, the fifty with the smattering of
Latin would possess some slight impulse towards analyzing the legal

direction. Placed on a distant frontier with a task of building a

8. The study of Latin introduces the pupil ιιι its later stages to a ι
conscious discernment of art in language-—the artistic and beautiful
in expression—and this to a degree which no modern tongue can do,
because, first, of its chaste severity of form, and, secondly, because
being so far removed from our own time, we can look at it as a fresh
and alien object. Thus by contrast our implicit feelings regarding
literary form in our own tongue are brought into explicit conscious-
ness—-raised, in short, from vague feeling into knowledge.

9. The study of Latin, especially in its later stageS, when it is
accompanied by the study of the life, art, and literature of Rome, has
a remarkable influence on the tone of thought and character. It has
