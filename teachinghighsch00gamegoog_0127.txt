CLASSROOM EQUIPMEN T 1 13

8. Home-made inustrative materiam—In every class
there may be some students of a mechanical turn of mind,
and these are-easily interested in making, in model, copies
of objects which are daily kept before the claSS, particularly
while reading Caesar. v

Dimensions for such things as the pilum, hasta, gladius,
sicca, scor-pia, tormenta, scutum, and the like, may be found
in the various reference bookS, as can good wood-cuts.
From these, even where accurate dimensions are not
obtainable, satisfactory working estimates can be made
which will answer every purpose. · The famous bridge can
be built by any boy who makes the effort, and the teacher
who has not had this done should busy himself immediately.

’ Also he can ,make, or get a student to make the vinea,'

scorpiO, arieS, turriS, and similar implements, fairly good
designs for which are given in the textbooks-.

It is very profitable to have some of the girl students
make, in model also, articles of dreSS, as the toga, stola,
and the like. Some teachers, find it possible to have one
or more togaS, pairs of sandaIS‚ stola5, ete., of full size, a
practice which is commendable wherever practicable. If
suitable miniature figures are obtainable, good results
may be obtained by having these dressed completely, one
each as imperator, legabuS, centuria, and so on, after the
designs given in the various texts,

This list does not include a large number of reliable
houses from which supplies may be secured. It has seemed
better to give a few of the best, rather than a complete list.
-Those who prefer a larger number from which to select any
articles wanted will find such a list, prepared by Miss
Loura B. Woodruff, in the Classical Journal, XI, 3.
