THE LATIN BIBLE, LATIN HYMNS, ΑΝΙ) SONGS

A. The Latin Bible.—Students are always pleased
when some part of the day's lesson touches upon things
in which they are ordinarily interested. You can make use
of this characteristic by keeping a copy of the Latin New
Testament on your desk, as it will be a means of awakenin g
many a boy and turning to good account an hour that
started off without promise. The T wenty-third Psalm‚
the BeatitudeS, the Lord's Prayer, and other familiar
selections offer themselves„ and you will be delighted
with the reception which will greet your reading of these
passages.

You can add to the interest by reading the Latin
sentence and calling sor 'someone to repeat it. T hen let
some pupil , give an English passage and call on the class .
to tu'rn it into Latin. An English concordance at hand
will help in finding these passages. Sometimes pupils
will wish to commit passages to memory. In this case,
place these passages on the blackboard.

The Beza edition of the New Testament and Psalms
in Latin and the Latin Vulgate Bible may be ordered from
any general bookstore. The Vulgate Bible is now under-
going revision and the new edition will doubtless be
available shortly.

Some selectionS.-—-That you may be able to test this
use of Bible selectionS, a few passages are given which
you may use in your classes at some favorable oppor-
tunity.
