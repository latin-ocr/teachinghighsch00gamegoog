value of these review drills and enter into them heartily.
Now and then it is well to call on a particular pupil, but in

the main have all recite in concert. Even the slowest will

get the forms after awhile.

Assigning the next Iesson.—Always use the last few
minutes of the period in going over the next day's assign-
ment and making plain just what is to be done. If there
are new wordS, pronounce them and have the class repeat
them after you. If the sentences seem involved or difficult,
translate one or two and give the class a start.

The Latin-English exercise.—Usually each lesson has
a Latin exercise for translation into English. As directed
above, always go over this exercise the day before you '
expect the recitation. If any of the sentences are unusually
difficult, try to clear up any part that may seem puzzling.
At recitation‚ call on some pupils to read the Latin sentence,
then let all the pupils read it together. Do not accept a
slow pronouncing of the words, but require a rapid reading ·
——this certainly after the class has worked a month or so,
The same pupil who first read, or some other, may now be
called on to translate. If his translation is correct, have all
the members translate together. If the first recitation
is not quite accurate, the teacher should give an accurate
translation, after which all the pupils might translate in
concert. N ever let a pupil translate word for word, aS,
“Caesar‚ Caesar, dixit, said,'' but require a straightforward
rendering into good English. If an exercise is found dif-
ficult‚ call it up again the next day for a rapid re-reading.

This plan may be varied now and then by reading the
sentences slowly and accurately to the claSS, and by having
pupils give the translation without looking at the book.
This training by hearing is decidedly valuable.
