TRAINING OF THE LATIN TEACHER 43

It is an evidence of the “final perseverance'' of Latin2
if we may so call it, that, notwithstanding the poor results
too often secured in‘such schools, and the 'general suscep-
tibility of the average school board to the demand for the
practical‚ fathers and mothers still believe in Latin and
insist that their 'sons and daughters shall have an opportu-
nity to study it during their high-school course. This faith
should be honored by an earnest effort on the part of colleges
and universities to prepare a sufficient supply of teachers ⁸
to meet the demand. It certainly behooves those who are
high-priests in the classical temple to stir their young
novices to a fuller preparation, and themselves to fumish
the best possible models for the hundreds who in devoted
aUegiance crowd about their altars. Some of the best
Latin teaching done in this country is done in the larger
, colleges and universities—and also some of the poorest.
That Latin has survived the deadening effect of poor teach-
ing in such surroundings is abundant evidence of its “final
perseverance.'' ’ ,

There are no reasons for· the training of a teacher for any
kind of work that do not apply quite as well to those who
are to do the work in Latins The cause of Latin, as has
been indicated elsewhere, is to a large extent bound up
with the question of better Latin teaching. If we can get
good teacherS, or, rather, a larger supply of the kind who
make Latin interesting and profitable‚ ¹⁴we shall cease to
hear anything said about leaving Latin out of our schools.
