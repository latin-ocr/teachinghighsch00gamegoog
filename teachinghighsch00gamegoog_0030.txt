Β and better things of life, or merely first, last, and all the
time, a servant of his trade or profession. Nature has
much to do with these qualities3 but it is submitted that ‚
an education which neglects the culture element, which
fails to take these native forces and to polish and refine

of the common good, by reason of this neglect is a destroyer
of what heaven meant for a blessing to society.

be so coldly professional, should not so severely stress the
making osa professional out of the man, that he will become
not more than a mechanical device, that he will fail to
become a full, open-minded, generous-hearted man. The
training of the man should have the first place, and the
training for a livelilzood should be secondary.
