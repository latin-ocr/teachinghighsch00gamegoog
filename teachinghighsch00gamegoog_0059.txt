and there should be a fair degree of familiarity with the
bibliography of the authors read.

. 4. Training in the collection and use os collateral material.
-When the teacher has listened to the reading of a chapter
from Caesar and criticized the reader, only a small part ,of
the hour's work has been done. That is not Latin teaching.
Even after the translation is over, after all forms have been
reviewed and the constructions reported on, the work is
not over. The teacher who knows what collateral material
is available for awakening the interest of his class, and then
collects that material for actual use, will never fail to get
good results in his drills on forms and constructionS‚ or
in other hard work. A careless teacher objects to this as
unnecessary, but herein lies the real teacher's oppor-
tunity to make his teaching touch ordinary life. Pupils
may forget the sentences read, but they will not forget
the story of old Appius ClaudiuS‚ or the picture of the
Pantheon, or the little song sung in Latin. These things
are worth while. This part of the course should include
a working familiarity with Sandys' Campanion to Latin
Studia, which is the best of the volumes of this kind
available. '

5. Praetice teaching during the wan—N ot much can
be said in favor of this from the viewpoint of those prac-
ticed on, but if the college is so organized that prospective
teachers of Latin can teach under competent supervision
for awhile, this practice will prove very helpful. Probably
the pupils who are thus taught will be so protected by the
critic teacher in charge that they will not be injured more
than they would be at the hands of the ordinary untrained
teacher.
