30 Ι TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

the seventh and eighth grades and the high school is supposed to ‚
represent—that instruction in history, in geography, in literature, is
really vocational educational, preparing for the “white-collar'’
occupationS. And so we have the proposals for differentiated courses
in history, and we have proposals for even experiments in the teach·
ing of English which would relegate the great masterpieces to the
white-collar pupi15‚ and seed those destined for other callings
on the inspiring contents of poultry bulletins and mail-order
catalogues ..... ,

Most of those who advocate early vocational differentiation are
not thinking of their own children. Of course a broad and liberal

- training is presupposed for them. These opportunities for early

vocational choices are for other people's children .....
In the last analysis, the efficiency of our educational system de-

pends upon the capacity of our boys and girls to do “ hard, uncoaxed,
uncomplimented work willingly and heartily.'' . . . .

In our educational theory we have certainly gone too far, and
educational practice has gone about as far-as it is safe to venture
without a counteracting movement. In my opinion, the time is
ripe for a little tincture of iron in our educational philosophy3 for a
touch of a more virile idealism; for a renaissance of thoroughness and
a reasonable measure of rigor3 for something approaching a revival of
the ideals of duty and effort.1
