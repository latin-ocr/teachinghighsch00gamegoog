narily this is a bad plan, but it does break into the “per-
sonal liberty'' of the translation fiend to rattle over the
page. Let him give Latin word and English equivalent,
word by word, and he will be forced to work out his lesson
somewhat closely even if he does hold to his handy mount.

Should Latin be required of all pupils r—That depends
upon the nature of the school. Some private institutions
regularly require Latin of all their pupils, and will admit
no one who does not want Latin. This is entirely right
