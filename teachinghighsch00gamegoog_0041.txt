CLASSICAL STUDIES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEFENSIVE 27

the sciences can· do very little, and must give this task ⁴
. over to subjects which,are known to secure this very result.

Both the sciences and the foreign languages have fields
ready at hand, with work rather definitely outlined.
Students in the classics should be encouraged to get all
the 56161166 60111565 possible, and teachers 01 1116 sciences
who are thinking 01 1116 1111616515 01 111611 pupils, rather than
01 petty wrangles about the utility of science‚· will urge upon

⁴ their classes the claims 01 1116 languages, ancient and
modern.

5. Other objections.—

a) “A waste 01 Q e’': This is an objection which can
be made only by those who do not know what is done by
the various subjects taught in the 56110015, and it holds
about as well against one subject as another. Reducing the
matter to 1116 last word, we all know that men have lived and
done well without knowing anything about Latin, as they
have done without a knowledge 01 grammar, arithmetiC,
algebra‚ geometry, or even 01 reading and writing. This 15,
however, very poor evidence to show that they would not
have done better 11 they had learned these things at the
right time. In fact, 11 we take out all the subject‘s which
'may seem unnecessary, that is, which have no direct bearing
on making a living, and then take from-the others the parts
which are 01110 practical use, we shall have very 111116 1611.
Take mathematics, for instance. The average business man
has little use 101 anything beyond simple arithmetiC, and no
use 101 11111611 01 that. Ι1 116 buys‘, the 561161 111111151165 1116
figures by which he must pay, 'and even he uses a 101111 book
in which the prices are all worked out. If he sells, he uses
the ready-made tables. Ι1 116 goes to the bank, the cashier

’ 1111115 10 1115 101111 book and the transaction is completed.
