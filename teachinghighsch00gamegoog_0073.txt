FIRST-YEAR LATIN 59

should this strain be placed upon them, or even upon the
experienced teacher ? What is the good of it? ,

Α5 this material is given, each lesson usually has a few
declensionS, or parts of a conjugation, then a vocabulary,
then a few ruIes of syntax, with explanations; after this,
from ten to twenty-five Latin-into-English sentences,
followed by ten to fifteen English-into-Latin sentences,
Suppose that a teacher gives one-half of this material
one day, and the other part the day following. The bulk
of the work will be in the second half, unless there is expert
division. Also‚ some of these lessons will be sufficient for
two dayS, some for three dayS, or possibly more, where the
subject is very difficult. ι

Most high schools have a session of nine monthS, or
thirty-six weeks. In this time, certain days must be
counted out for holidays. T hirty-six weekS, of five reci-
tations a week, would require 180 lessons. If sufficient
provision is made for reviews and written examinationS,
there is no objection to providing for the full 180 IessonS,
as the holidays could take the place of reviews now and
then. A text of 160 lessonS, well worked out, would have
-its strong appeal, inasmuch as this would leave some little
time at the disposal of the experienced teacher and would
still help the inexperienced one in reaching the conclusion
of a year's work with some peace of mind. Plain common-
sense would advise a readjustment of first-year Latin texts
in this particular.

An editor, knowing these thingS, would do much more for
those who use his textis he would make the divisions before-
hand‚ and save the loss and confusion which rnust follow
mere guesswork in dividing. He can place in one “ lesson '’
just what the average. high-school pupil can do in one
