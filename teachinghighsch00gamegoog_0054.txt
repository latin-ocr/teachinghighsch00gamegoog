CHAPTER V
THE TRAINING OF THE LATIN TEACHER

Prepare to teach the subject you have selected.—
After the young teacher has selected his subject, it becomes
his duty to prepare himself as thoroughly as he can for the
work he is to do. He is especially fortunate if he can make
his decision early in his college course.

Latin teachers must know Latin.—In some subjects a
teacher may be able to keep up appearances without
knowing very much about his work, but Latin is not one
of these. The teacher either knows Latin or does not, and
the weakest pupil in his class will not be long in finding out
the truth. A knowledge of the language and literature is -
an absolute necessity, and there is no way· of dodging this
demand. Efforts at teaching Latin without a sufficient
knowledge invariably bring confusion and disaster, as
many a teacher can testify. While yet in college, the young
teacher should take every course in Latin that he can, and
should get as much Greek as he can find time for, as Greek
is an essential factor in good Latin teaching.

Latin teachers must know how to teach Latin.—In
addition to an accurate knowledge of the subject-matter,
it is important to be able to teach it in an effective manner.
Very few are “born teachers’'; most of those who imagine
that they are have little evidence to back their claimS.
The great majority may do fairly well at first, if they know
the subject, but their teaching is largely experimental,

‘ until, after much experience, they find the best ways and
means of teaching. There is no good reason, however,
