If you buy in the order given, you will not be far wrong.

The spate moments.——The history of Rome must
furnish the background for this year's work. You will be
fortunate if your pupils have had a year of ancient or general
history before reaching Cicero. Heavy stress must be laid
on the life and customs of the people. The city itself‚ its
topography and monumentS, should be studied as time
allows. The wall picture5‚ lantern slideS‚ and other
illustrative material referred to elsewhere, with those in
the textbook, will help greatly in making Cicero's orations
interesting. Try to get each pupil to read one of the lives
of Cicero and the volume by Church or by Johnston. The
parallel between the political parties in Rome and in our
country is worth presenting.
