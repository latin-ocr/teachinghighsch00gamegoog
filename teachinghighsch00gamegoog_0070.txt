56 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

backing the book and placing it in every possible
opening.

It must be stated,·however, that the publishers do not
often force the sale of a book beyond its worth. If for a
short time they make glowing reportS, facts eventually
force them to a more sober view of the case and the book
gradually finds its proper place.

Latin teaching, especially in the first year, has suffered
severely from the mistakes of publishers wh0, as a business
proposition, have ‘pushed into the schools books which
have not rendered good service.

Who should select the text ?—1t is generally best for
the man who is to use an instrument or machine to select
the particular one with which he feels sure of getting results.
So it is with the teacher and his text. Circumstances some-
times prevent this, as when the text is selected by a state
or city board, or by the head of a department in a large
system of schools. In this way some advantages are
secured, as in prices , and exchange rates, If possible,
however, large deference should be shown the teacher who
is to use* the book.

If the text selected does not suit the teacher exactly,
it is anthe more necessary for him to exert himself and
from his own knowledge to supplement the adopted text
so as to secure results in spite of the challenge of an unsatis-
factory book. His ability to do good work, in face of the
limitation placed upon him, is a good test of his worth as
a teacher.
