LATIN'S SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE 17

Up to the age' of thirty and beyond it, poetry of many kinds,
such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron‚ Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Shelley, gave me great delight, and even as a schoolboy I took intense
delight in Shakespeare. But now for many years I cannot read a
line of poetry3 I have tried to read Shakespeare, and found it so
intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have lost my taste for pic-
tureS, and for music. My mind seems to have become a kind of
machine for grinding general laws out of a large collection of facts,
but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain
on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive ..... The
loss of these tastes is a loss of happineSS, and may possibly be injurious
to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character, by enfeeb-
ling the emotional part of our nature. '

On this Professor Walter Miller says:

If Charles Darwin found the loss of his higher aesthetic tastes
so lamentable, how much more lamentable must be the paralysis
of the intellectual power when this exclusive devotion to the culti—
vation of one side of the intellectual nature begins before the mind
has fairly developed. But utilitarianism, with promises of material
wealth, is ready with her reply: “ Seek ye first money; culture after
wealth,'' and technical education without the basis of broad culture
has grown and spread to an incredible extent. Said President
Butler: “Its essential narrowness and philistinism increase with its
success in establishing itself, and it promises for a long time to come
to assert its overwhelming ascendancy, until a race of men shall come
upon the stage with about as much religion as a threshing-machine‚
and hardly more social charm than a storage battery.''¹

Mr. Williams‚ in conclusion.—This bearing of the
classics upon the larger and more vital phases of human
life can hardly be presented more convincingly than in
these wordS, taken from the address already referred to,
of Mr. Williams of the I ndianapolis N ews:

It does make a difference‚ a very great and momentous difference,
to my notion‚ what a youth studies in his formative and impression—
