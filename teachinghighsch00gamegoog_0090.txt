76 TEACHI NG HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

2. Classes are not often ready for Caesar at the opening
of the second year. Few of the usual books prepare for
Caesar, and it is doubtful if the average pupil can get
ready for Caesar in one school year of nine monthS, with-
out negleeting some of his other studies· Caesar is more
difficult Latin than its place in the course of study would
indicate. It is quite as difficult as the German and French
used in the fourth year of the high school, in every par-
ticular—syntaX, vocabulary, etc. It really ought to be
given in the'third year, for it is the rock on which unnum-
bered thousands of faithful pupils have gone to pieces

For nine out of every ten classeS, it is best ‚to begin with
some simffle Latin and review the forms and simple con—
structions of the first year. This can be done by using the
Gradatim, Fabulae Faciles, Via Latina, etc„ or one of the
second-year volumes specially prepared to take the place
of a full year of Caesar. They generally give about the
second half of the year to Caesar.

Selections from modern Latin, as'suggested above, or
from EutropiuS, NepoS, and others, can be adapted to this
purpose. Probably the best material available isin Late
Latin, which is particularly rich in human interest. The
book should follow the plans suggested for the first year,
that is, should give attention to optional material along

with the required, to verseS, notes on Roman life, society, - ·

government, and the like, and should simply continue the
interest there aroused. If the book contains the necessary
grammar, noteS, and prose composition, it will 'be all the
better.

Circumstances will have to determine your course.
