4 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

c) Professor Laurie, U niversity of Edinburgh.÷-In his
volume Lectures on Language and Linguistic M ethod,
· chap. ix, Professor Laurie gives the following “reasons

· for teaching Latin'': '

We teach Latin— .

1. Because as a formal and grammatical study it has peculiar
advantageS, and more than any other language (except Greek) gives Π
discipline to the mtelligence, and the result of discipline, viz., intel-
lectual power.

2. The study of Latin gives (to an Englishman at least), more
than any other language can do, a training in words—the relative
values and the functions of words-—and, consequently, training in the
thought-things which words denote. The shades of meaning in
vocables are brought into high relief.

3. The analysis and subsequent synthesis whereby we truly
'comprehend an English sentence, and which is a direct training of
the processes of mind in knowing (in the scientific or any other field),
are most effective as training when it is a foreign ton e that we are
teaching; and, above all, when that tongue is Latin. his is because,
in order to produce an English translation, a pupil is forced, whether
he will or not, deliberately and of set purpose to consider the mutual
relations of the parts of a complex sentence; and, secondly, because
of the exactness and precision with which these logical relations are
brought into prominence in a highly synthetic language„ In thisd
relation, Latin is better than Greek, because there is less deviation
in it from a normal type. There is breadth, strength, and simplicity
about its grammar ..... ·

4. The working out 'of a translation from a foreign tongue is
further a training of the imagination, which has to bring itself into
play in order to unite into a whole, in their true signification, the parts
of a sentence. Latin in a special sense gives this training because
of its remoteneSS. The imagination, moreover, is checked and kept
within the wholesome bounds of truthfulness by comparing the
results achieved with the original.

5. Latin is to a very large extent (to the extent of two-thirds
at least) our own tongue. In studying Latin, therefore, we are
studying our own tongue in its sources, and getting all the discipline
