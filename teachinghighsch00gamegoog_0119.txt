Latin Songs, with Music, by Professor Calvin S. Brown

C. Latin Songs.—-What was said of Latin hymns is
equally in place for Latin songS, with the additional con-
sideration that songs can be used on many occasions where
the hymns cannot.

Some selected songs.-——In order that you may test this
plan, a few Latin songs are given:

1. “Lauriger HoratiuS,'' by an unknown author 3

Lauriger HoratiuS,
Quam dixisti verum:
Fugit Euro· citius
Tempus edax rerum.

Cnorms. Ubi sunt, O pocula,
Dulciora melle,
Rixae, pax, et oscula,
Rubentis puellae.

Crescit uva molliter,
Et puella crescit3
Sec poeta turpiter
Sitiens canescit.

Cnosos,

Quid iuvat aeternitas
Nominis amare

Nisi terrae filias
Licet et potare?

CHORUS.

ι Music: That commonly associated with “ Maryland‚ My
Maryland.'' .
