‚VALUE oF LATrN STUDY 53

A number of these subjects are offered in schools where
no Latin is taught, as in technical schools Generally,
algebra, geometry‚ rhetoric, English literature, history,
and some of the sciences are required. Percentages based
on shifting data are necessarily meaningless. The actual
numbers more nearly represent the⁴ facts in the case.
N umbers are not the only consideration, however, as school
officers know that Latin attracts the very best talent in a
body of students and offers no attraction to weaklings and
triflers. ,

Latin has made its showing without a favored place in
the curriculum, so far as most high schools are concerned,
and ·frequently against the opposition of administrative
officers. It haS, at the most, had a place in'a so-called
“ classical course '' which is paralleled by a. number of other
courses which lead to the same diploma and which are
declared to be “ equal in value to the Classical course.''

The people of this country believe in Latin. Those who . .

seek the best possible training for their children want
Latin included in the list of subjects which they study.
