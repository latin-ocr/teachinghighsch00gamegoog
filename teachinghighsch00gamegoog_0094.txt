80 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN .

5. Call on the members of the claSS‚ one by one,.after
some system, for the translation. If the passage assigned
to one pupil is long, direct a second pupil to be ready to
relieve the reader at a certain point. Have the new reader
go back and bring up what the former reader went over and
complete the passage. Constant repetition of a translation
will do no harm. ·

After the lesson has been read in this way, allowing
objectionS, criticisms‚ and questions after each reader
finisheS, have one or two pupils read , the entire lesson
through rapidly'. It is then your turn to read it through,

assign only the nominatives for the first week; then the
accusatives for two or three weeks; the datives for the next
two weeks; then the ablatives for two or three months.
This is easily done. Ask the pupils to find the ablatives
in the next day's lesson, for instance, with the reason for
each one. Suppose a case: p. 24, l. 12, legibus usi sunt.
Legibus is ablative with utam· Grammar, ξ 264. Then
have the class turn to the reference and read it together.

Only the forms and the cases should be taken up for.
the first five or six months. Then, if this part is well
