CLASSICAL STUDIES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEFENSIVE 2 5

ments in the high schools is well set forth in the following
passage from an address by Professor E. A. Hayden:

Laboratory experiments multiplied beyond all reason; labora-
tory manuals so minute in their specifications that no place is left
to the student for that effort and rumination which is indispensable
to the growth of strong mental tissue; inadequate mathematical
preparation for physics that makes the 'subject largely a juggling
of apparatus and mechanical application of predigested formulae
to concrete data; geometry boiled down until its real essence and
spirit—the intuitive apprehension of spatial magnitudes--is com-
pletely volatilized—these are. a few of the results of this severish
passion for obvious external results, Mere activity, mere busyness
that expends itself in tinkering with an infinitude of trifling detail5‚
is a sheer waste of time and energy.

Reference may be made here, with great timelines5‚
to an experience in the history of education in Germany. -

In 1870 the German government asked the University of ’

Berlin to consider⁸ the admission of graduates of the
Realschule to the university on equal terms with those of
the Gymnasium, whose training is based largely on the
classim, indicating -in this request that the Realschule
afforded an equivalent preparation for advanced study.
The philosophical faculty replied—

that the non—classical training is incapable of furnishing a preparation
for academie studies equal to that afforded by classical training3
that all efforts to find a substitute for the classical languageS, whether
in' mathematicS, or in the modern language5‚ or in the natural scienceS‚
have hitherto been unsuccessfu13 that after long and vain search
we must come back finally to the result of centuries of experience‚ that
the surest instrument that can be used in the training of the minds

of the youth is given to us in the languages‚ the literature, and the
works of art of classical antiquity.

In spite of this, the government opened up the univer-
sities to the graduates of these technical high schOOIS.
