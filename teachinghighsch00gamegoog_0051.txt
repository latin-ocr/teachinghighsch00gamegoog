THE TEACHER AND HIS SUBJECT 37

Believe in your subject.—N0 matter what his natural ·

bent, or his, training, the Latin teacher cannot do his best
work unless he has a fixed saith in the efficiency of his sub-
ject as a means to an end. One who tries to teach any
subject in a half-hearted way is doing a positive wrong to
those who are unfortunate enough to be forced to suffer
, at his hands. 'The young Latin teacher should make an
investigation into the facts of the case and know what has

been accomplished by Latin 1n the centuries past and what ,

is now being done. In addition to this, he should watch
the work of his own classes with a view to building up his
saith in the effectiveness of Latin in his own hands, A
Latin teacher who knows what he 1s expected to do with
Latin, and knows that he can· do that very thing, is bound
to secure the best results possible.

School officers careless.—Occasionally conditions are
met with in which the preferences and special fitness of the
teachers do not determine assignmentS, as when school
officers· allow family connection and political alignments
to influence‚ to some extent, their choice of teachers. In a
group of teachers elected thus and turned over to the prin-
cipal for assignmentS, there may be no one who is prepared
to do good work in Latin. Teachers who depend upon
local influence for appointments are not the kind who make
preparation for teaching anything in particular, Latin
least of all. The teacher who has Latin thus thrust 'upon
hirn, despite his utter unpreparedness for teaching it, is
likely to become rebellious‚ and his attitude will add greatly
to the burdens of Latin. Parents and pupils naturally con-
nect the subject and the teacher, every weakness of the
teacher being placed to the account of the subject which he
teacheS.
