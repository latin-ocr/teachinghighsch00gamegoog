The spate momenta—During this year, careful atten-
tion must be given to the study of mythology, and to this
much of your spate time will be given. Pupils should study
Vergil's Aeneid as literature and not for purposes of syn-
tactical analysis. The amount of extra syntax necessary
to understand Vergil is very small, if the work os the other
years has been well done. You should therefore plan for
a part of each hour to be used in bringing your class into ’
touch with the fine arts of the Greeks and RomanS, par-
ticularly sculpture. The photographS, printS, and lantern
slides referred to elsewhere will do good service. Look
ahead and have the appropriate photographs or prints
ready at the right time. Now and then read for the class
a verse translation of a selection from the Iliad or the
Odyssey. Also, read often from a translation of the·
Eclogues and Georgics of Vergil, and from the Metamorphoses
of Ovid. The volumes of the “Loeb Classical Library''
are splendidly adapted to this purpose. By all means read
to the class Tennyson's “Oenone‚'' “TithonuS,'' and
“Vergil,'' Shelley's “Arethusa,'' and Longfellow's “Encela-
dus,'' even if something else must be neglected. Also, try
to get ’some of the more beautiful passages committed to
memory by the pupiIS, aS, for instance, Book VI, 883—86,
“manibus date lilia plenis''; i. 607—10, “In freta dum fluvii
,Α current,'' ete.
