cated. These courses naturally vary, some of them being
of more practical value than others. Without trying to
mark out a complete program, emphasis may be placed
upon the following features:

1 . The place and value os Latin in an educational sys-
tem—A teacher cannot succeed with a subject of the value
of which he is uninformed. Latin can do its part in educa-
