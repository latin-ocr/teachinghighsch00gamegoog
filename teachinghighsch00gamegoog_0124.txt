read, the more the better, and all the Latin grammars }

commonly referred to in the editions of the authors. It is

worth while to have a number of the texts used in Latin <

prose composition, particularly for purposes of comparison.
The teacher should endeavor to secure copies of every

available text for beginning Latin students, and if a few ’
of those used in Canada and England are secured they 'will ἴ

3. Wall Pictures.—Every Latin classroom should have ⁴

a number of photographic enlargements of important
features of Rome and the adjacent region. The following
are of interest: the Forum, one view looking east and one

of Titus, Septimius SeveruS, and Constantine, the Tomb of
Hadrian, and the Tiber River3 a view of Pompeii> with
Vesuvius in the background. A view of the Acropolis and
the Parthenon is also desirable.

Any of the dealers in lantern slides and photographs
can furnish photographic prints which can be readily
enlarged. The Soule Art vPublishing Company, Boston‚
MassachusettS, and the Records of the Past Exploration
Society, 'Washington, D.C., will send prints on approval,
and from these you can make selections which they will
enlarge and‘frame, if you wish. ’ ¹

The size and plan of your classroom and the subject of
the picture will determine the size of the pictures that will
harmonize with their surroundings. These sizes are good:
24><30‚ 22><32, 27><37, 25><35‚ 22><28, 2o>< 26. Smaller
sizes can be made, as 14>< 18, 12>< 16, and on down. Plan
your sizes to fit into the wall space available. The bromide
enlargements will serve every purpose. ·
