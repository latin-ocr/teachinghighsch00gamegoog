THE TExT: 1Ts AUTHoR 5 5

service, it is safe to use one in which a successful college or
uni-versity professor of Latin has co-operated with a suc-
cessful teacher of high-school Latin. That is about as
far as we can g0, where all parties to a book venture are
unknown to the teacher who must find his text.

It 15 fair to say that some of the first· -year Latin texts
which have had the smallest sales are really good texts and
that some of the poorest texts have had large sales, 1n the
face of the breakdown of the classes which have been
dragged along through their pageS.

What about the publisher ?—1t does not matter greatly
Each house presenting one or more books will set forth the
strong features 1n strong terms. If pressed‚ they can also
set forth the weak places of the other publisher’s books.
T eachers may well hear all arguments, but it is not safe
to take a book simply because the representative of a
given house is a better advocate than his competitor.
For instance, it is told of one representative that he secured
the adoption of his first-year textbook by a committee
of business men on the argument that his book actually
had one hundred words more in its vocabulary than the
other book under consideration! Another, by loosening a
few threadS, actually shook a competing book until it fell
to pieces.

A good test of a book's value is the kind of schools that
use it. However, the best schools are continually changing,
in the hope of finding something better than they are using.
Use quickly reveals to the trained teacher the weakness
of any textbook. So the report that a publisher shows you
of the large adoption and of the high schools using his
books may be good evidence of the value of the bookS, or it
may be merely evidence of a perfect business organization
