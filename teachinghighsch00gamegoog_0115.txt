THE LATIN BIBLE, HYMNS, AND SONGS ⁴ 101

21mpinguasti in oleo caput meum: et calix meus inebrians quam
praeclarus est!

Et misericordia tua subsequetur me omnibus diebus vitae meae.

Et ut inhabitem in domo Domini, in longitudinem dierum.

B. Latin hymns.-You may use a few Latin hymns in
a similar way. Young people are always glad to sing, if
it means relief from class work for the time being. Schools
can use this disposition to good purposes now and then,
especially when times of stress and nerve strain call for
some means of averting trouble: A Latin song is very·
effective, and a class can usually be interested by the first
suggestion of such a song. Latin hymns are frequently
given with English translations 3 this can be turned to good
account, as by reading the Latin to the class and inviting
an English translation. ·

The Latin hymns are a great literature in themselves ,

’ and for their own sake are worth knowing. The modern
chur'ches make use of a limited number in translationS, and
these constitute about the best we have in our hymnals.
Some do not lend themselves to translation readily, but
they should still have a place in our singing. The audience
would not be able to follow the thought, it is true, but very
few of us know what is being said by the choir anyway‚
and we have to take for granted that it is all right. If we
knew that they were singing one of the great Latin hymnS, ¹
that fact would afford no little satisfaction‚ and would
compensate us for our inability to find words in the
sounds made.

Some selected hymnS.—-T he following Latin hymnS‚
simple in thought and easy of translation, are given in
order that teachers may try the effect of thern upon their
classes:
