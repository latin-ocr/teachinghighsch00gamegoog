26 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

After ten years of experimenting, the 'entire faculty,
professors of natural and physical sciences included,
declared that in spite of the start gained in scientific study.
by the graduates of the technicalschOOIS, they were speedily
overtaken by the graduates of the classical institutions,
and left in the rear. The entire faculty petitioned the
govemment to repeal its decree and to admit to the uni-
versity only such students as had· received the training of
the classicS, as the only adequate training for university
study. On this petition were the names of Liebig, Helm-
holtz, Hoffmann, Rammelsberg, Mommsen, Curtius, and
others of equal fame.¹ ' ’
From this discussion it must not be inferred that the
writer is opposed to the teaching of the sciences in, our
' schools. He believes most strongly in these subjects as
educational instrumentS. Notwithstanding all that has
been said about the possibilities of science instruction, the

results seem to fall very far short. The sciences should ·

hold a place in the high-school course, and our young
people should study science, utility or no utility. No one
can pretend to have an education who does not know

, something of science, but he must be prepared to unlearn

it every few years, in the very nature of the case.

The teachers of Latin are as good friends of the sciences
as can be found, notwithstanding the effort to alienate
them. For a kind of training which is essential, that which
leads to habits of investigation and patient searching after
facts in a given case and of following them to their definite
conclusion, the sciences when properly taught have a
place that nothing else can fill. When it comes to training
in chaste and accurate expression of the facts ascertained,
