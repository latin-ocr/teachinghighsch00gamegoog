CHAPTER IX

FIRST-YEAR LATIN

Selecting the text.—-The very best text available should
be placed in the hands of those who are beginning Latin.
This is the year in which large numbers who start Latin
fail so utterly to do anything with it that they do not even
see how it can be of value to others who may-succeed with
it. F acing this serious task, young teachers may prefer
-to use the text which they themselves studied in high
school. While this may do as a beginning, they should
search for better texts and better methods of teaching the
subject.

Whoever selects the text, whether teacher or school
board, the following considerations should largely deter-
mine the choice:

. 1. T he text should be thoroughly systematic.—There
should be a definite plan in the text, and it should be devel-
oped consistently. A large number of the texts now avail-
able have not impressed teachers as having any very
strong purpose or as being logically planned out. Several
have good single featureS, and are good at some points
while unsatisfactory at others. They all represent a
sincere effort to improve Latin teaching in the 56110015,
but unfortunately many-of them cannot be used with any
degree of success

2. A full year's work should be definitely planned out.—
The texts prepared by Collar and Daniell, some years ag0,
held to about 7 5 lessonS, and apparently fixed for others
which came after them the number of lessons for first-year
