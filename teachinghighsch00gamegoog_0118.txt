104 'TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

Music: “Dies Irae‚” found in all hymnals, usually with a
translation entitled “Day of Wrath, Ο Dreadful Day.''

4. Another hymn which will interest students is Glad-
stone’s rendering of Toplady's “Rock of Ages'’:

Iesu, pro me perforatuS, Nil in manu mecum fero,

Condat intra tuum latuS‚ Sed me versus crucem gero;
Tu per lympham profluentem, Vestimenta nudus oro,

Tu per sanguinem tepentem, Opem debilis imploro;

In peccata mi redunda‚ F ontemChristiquaero immundus , ’
Tolle culpani, sordes munda. Nisi laveS, moribundus,
Coram te nec iustus forem, Dum hos artus vita regit3
Quamvis tota vi laborem, Quando nox sepulchro tegit3
Nec si fide nunquam ceSSO, Mortuos cum stare iubes ;
Fletu stillans indefesso: Sedens iudex inter nubes;
Tibi soli tantum, munus; Iesu, pro me perforatuS,
Salva me, Salvator unus! Condar intra tuum latus·

Music: “Rock of Age5,’' found in all hymnals. ’ The last
two syllables are read as one.

There are others in large numbers which can be' used
to good advantage, and teachers will do a large service for
general culture by bringing them to the attention os their
classes. “Te Deum laudamu5,'' by St. Ambrose; “ Grates
nunc omnes reddamuS,'' by Nokter, of St. Gal13 “ O quanta
qualia sunt illa Sabbata‚'' by Abelard; “Stabat mater
dolorosa,'' by Innocent ΙΙΙ; “Jerusalem luminosa,’' by
an unknown author; “Arx firma Deus noster est‚’' Butt-
man’s rendering of Luther's “ Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott,'’
are worthy of the time and effort of anyone who would

⁴ think the great thoughts of the choicest minds of all ages.
