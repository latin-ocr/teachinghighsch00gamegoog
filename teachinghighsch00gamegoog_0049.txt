CHAPTER IV

THE TEACHER AND HIS SUBJECT

Select your subject.—The high schools of this country
are commonly so organized that teachers are employed to
teach one or two of the subjects offered in the course of
study‚ rather than all the subjects of a grade or year.
This arrangement encourages special preparation on the
part of the teacher and should secure for the school a high

· grade of service. It is therefore of the largest ¹importance ⁵

that the prospective teacher decide as early as possible ·
on the' subject or subjects which appeal to him most
strongly and which he thinks he can teach most effec-
tively. Frequently those who look forward to teaching
find it necessary to defer this decision until after they
have taught for awhile and have had time to make up
their minds definitely. In such caseS, the delay ’ cannot
be avoided, but the pupils taught by a hesitating teacher
and the subjects used in his experiments will necessarily
suffer.

Who should teach a foreign language ?—In making his
selection from the number of subjects taught in the high-
schOOIS, several considerations must have due weight.
A slow, hesitating young man, if he teaches at all, should
not undertake foreign-language teaching, in which quick-
ness of thought and expression are absolutely necessary.
Also, one who has found foreign languages a difficult study
and has made unsatisfactory progress in· this kind of work
should not feel called upon to teach a foreign language,
Latin in particular, in later years
