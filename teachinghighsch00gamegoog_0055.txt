why the right training beforehand should not shorten the
period of experimenting and fit them for satisfactory work
from the start.

Professor Bennett’s caution.—The following caution
against emphasizing “method'' is offered by Professor

Bennett:

I have elsewhere called attention to what seems to me a dangerous
inference, likely to be drawn, and certainly not infrequently drawn,
in connection with modern pedagogy3 and I may perhaps not be
departing too far from my theme if Ι say again that teaching is not
the application of a method, but that, as Quintilian reminds· uS, it is
a constant adaptation to the problem momentarily in hand. ' It is
the very reverse of anything and everything mechanical. It there-
fore does not submit to the definite formulation of a method capable
of general application. The two essentials of the teacher are a knowl-
edge of his subject and skill in momentary adaptation. Accordingly,
when Ι note the prod-igious emphasis placed on “ method '' in prepara-
tion for the profession of teaching, I feel warranted in saying that such
emphasis is of doubtful wisdom, since it involves the assumption

that knowledge is of less account than method, that method either ’
necessarily carries with it capacity for the skilful adaptation requisite
in teaching, or is even superior to it.¹

This caution of Professor Bennett against overstress-
ing “method'' is very timely. There is a disposition,
particularly strong . in teacher-training institutionS, to
make “method'' the center of interest, the natural con-
sequence being a subordination of real scholarship. Where
“method’' becomes a substitute for scholarship‚ or for a
knowledge of the subject to be taught, it is a dangerous and
reprehensible thing. In this connection, we are advocating
an entirely different kind of 'method The prospective
teacher who knows his subject should have some training
in the-art of presenting it, so that from the very beginning
