28 Τ EACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

His adding is done by a machine, and his dictaphone and
typewriter remove the necessity of his knowing anything
more than how and where to stamp his name with a rubber
stamp. What need then has the average business man
for difficult arithmetic, or algebra, or plane or solid geom-
etry, to say nothing of higher mathematics? More than
this, one oi the great civil engineers of the country recently
stated that he had gone over his old texts in mathematics
to find out just how much of the mathematics he studied
in school had been used in his actual experience as head of
the engineering department of one of the great railway
systemS. He made the amazing statement that every-
thing he had used, of all the mathematics he had studied,
could be given in a booklet of about twenty-four pages. It
is doubtful whether he could have grasped and retained
this essential knowledge without the training he had
received in dealing with what he considers the nonessential
part. His feeling that he could have done so makes .his
contribution all the more interesting.

This reasoning holds of other subjects, such as physicS,
chemistry, history, English, geography, and the like. We
may as well understand that there is no intention, in any
sane educational system, of cramming into a pupil the few
data necessary for earning a livelihood. This is not the
great task of the schoolS. One needs a trained mind in
order to be able to make intelligent use of these ruleS,
tableS, and similar data; and to give this trained mind,
we have found nothing better suited than mathematiCS,
physiCS, chemistry, and the like.
