6 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

influence by connecting us in a living way with what seems, but truly
is not, a dead past, and thereby expanding our intellectual and moral
sympathies so as to embrace that past as part o‘f our own life. It
makes us members of 'a larger human society. Modern contemporary
language and life are too near to our own to have this cultivating
influence to the same extent, and do not teach us to see things in a
true perspective; they may be said to broaden our liveS, but they
do not lengthen them. Neither the Hindu nor the Chinese language
and life would serve, because they are not our past. The ancient
life, by thus stimulating the historical imagination and carrying it
out of the present, tends to give balance of mind, checks sciolism of
opinion and crudeness of judgment based on a narrow induction of
things which, as being close at hand, are apt to assume undue im-

Club, Editor Charles R. william, speaking on “ The Study
of Latin and Greek as a Training for Practical AffairS,''
gave the following summary of the results which follow
classical study:

world the study of the humanitieS, of Greek and Latin, is to be recom-
mended and urged, therefore, because of the thorough understanding
and mastery of English that it gives; because of the discipline of the
intellectual powers it affordS, in determining the precise meaning of
an author’s discourse; because of the knowledge gained of the sources
of our own language, our institutionS, and our culture; because of the
cultivation of taste that comes thereby for all that is high and fine
in literature and art; because of the wider vision it gives to the
spirit of. men, and because it deepens one's sense of the continuity
of culture, of the solidarity of the race, of our debt to the past, and
so of our obligation to the future.
