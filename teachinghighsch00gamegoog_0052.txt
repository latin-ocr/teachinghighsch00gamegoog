Under such circumstances Latin is helpless. Some
subjects are sels-protecting and warn off intruders. Chem-

blow embodied ignorance through the roos. Latin has
no such protection‚ and its only hope is that when it is

know to what extent nepotism and politics have operated
in keeping them weak.

Teachers sometimes at fault.—It happens all too
frequently that teachers accept positions in the high schools
for which they are not properly prepared. Latin has
