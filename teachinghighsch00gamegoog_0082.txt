68 TEACHIN G HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

The English-Latin exercise.—There are several ways
in which good results may be secured:

1. Students may be required to study and write out these
sentences before coming to elasa—In claSS, the student should
read each sentence carefully and give the exact Latin,
without referring to his written paper, of course. After
the exercise has been done in this way, all the pupils should
go to the blackboard and copy on the board the exercise as
they prepared it, leaving sufficient space between the lines
for corrections *Exchanges can be secured by moving all
students one exercise to the right or left, care being taken
that permanent places are so assigned that weak students
and strong students may alternate in order, for obvious
reasons The teacher should then go over the exercise,
sentence by sentence, giving the correct Latin, and dis-
cussing fully every question of form or syntax which may
arise. Each student should make the necessary correc-
tions in the work which falls to his charge. Time should
be taken for any who are not convinced of the correctness
of the s-tatements of the teacher, and the text should
settle any appeals to authority. Have some Latin gram-
mars at hand, in case fuller evidence is necessary. Where
blackboard facilities are insufficient, a part of the class can
be sent to the board each day. Another plan of grading is
to seat the class in two, or any other even number of -rOWS,
and to let the two rows of seats exchange papers for cor-
rection. The teacher can give the correct sentence and
the students can correct the mistakes found, if there are
any„ For this plan, it is necessary that students write
on alternate lineS, in order to avoid confusion. After
papers are returned, protests should be invited, and any
questions raised should have attention.
