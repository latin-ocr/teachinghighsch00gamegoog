FIRST-YEAR LATIN 69

2. Most os the texts give exercises based mainly on the·
rules of syntax found in the current less'on.—It would be
much better if the exercise were always based on con-
structions which have been thoroughly explained in class
in the lesson of the previous day. In spite'of all admoni-
tionS, pupils will persist in doing their written work before
they prepare the rules and vocabulary for the day.

Therefore the second plan suggested is that you assign
the English-Latin exercise for the day for sight translation
only. Go over each sentence carefully, and let it be under-
stood that you do not hold the class responsible for previous
preparation. Do not use this work in determining your
grades. Then, after every point has been cleared up,
assign the exercise for writing as part of the next recitation.
For instance: The lesson is on the ablative absolute. Let
the class prepare the Latin-English sentences as usual,

· but tell them not to try the English-Latin part. In class,

after the principle of the absolute construction has been
fully explained and the first part of the day's task has been
done, have the pupils go over the English-Latin sentences
at sight, calling on individuals as usual. After the sentence
has been given correctly, „have all repeat it in concert.
Direct them to bring in this exercise properly written out
the next day. ·

When the exercise is ready next day, you may proceed
according to the first plan above described. Begin with
an oral report on each sentence, if time permits; otherwise
send pupils to the blackboard and have them copy off their
report‚ as suggested above. With all this effort, your
pupils ought to get the lesson well in mind.

If papers show a decided weakneSS, return them for
rewriting.
