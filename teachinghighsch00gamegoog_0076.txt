words are easily remembered and are not a burden on the
memory, even though there has been a shift in meaning.
When such words are used, the size of the vocabulary is
of small moment. If the pupil sees porto, scribo, lauda,
hora, indignitaS, iniuria, labor, legia, and the like, he catches
instantly the relationship between them and the English
words he knowS, and the impression abides. Any little shifts
in meaning may be adjusted at leisure. Pupils take very
kindly to a vocabulary that is in ordinary touch with what
they already know. Latin can be learned quite as well
with these words as with any other list. ,

The number of words is not important. The outcry
about limiting the vocabulary to 500, or 600, or 700 words
is quite unnecessary. If the words show kinship to common
English wordS, a vocabulary of 2,000 words is no more
burdensome to a pupil than one os 400 studiously selected
from Caesar's Commentaries. A combination of about 500
simple words from Caesar and 500 of apparent kinship
to English derivatives would make a vocabulary that
ought to satisfy everybody, unless ‘indeed some teacher has
little enough of wisdom to try to have the entire vocabulary
committed to memory. The general vocabulary is for
reference purposeS, and may well contain quite a number of
words which are not given in the smaller vocabularies
intended as parts of recitations.

Many Latin teachers have had no experience, and the
editor should have had the training and experience which
enable him to make suggestions that will strengthen the
teacher's hands and help in presenting the material effect-
ively. Such suggestions add largely to the value of the
text, not only for the inexperienced teacher, but even for
