THIRD-YEAR LATrN 89

short story, chapters from the Bible, as, for instance, the
Twenty-third Psalm, the Pater Noster, the Beatitudes,
are always interesting. These can be written on the black-

’ board, or they can be used for hearing 'exercises As good

a plan as any is to re-read now and then some of the
chapters from Caesar which were read the previous year.
Go slowly in giving any new material, from Caesar or any-
where else, *unless you are sure that it is simple enough for
your clasS.

In the hearing exercise, read some simple story, as that
of “Sir Walter Raleigh '' in the Gradatim. Read a sentence
and call for translation, then read over the entire story-and
see whether all can follow the thought. This exercise is
well worth while.

Prose composition, and else.—What was said under
“ Second-Year Latin '' about written exerciseS, the narra-
tive, and a written translation is equally of importance
during this year. In the oral and the written exerciseS,
settle all questions on the authority of the grammar, which
should be kept always at hand. ῃ

The yearly theme.—For this essay, topics should be
assigned several months before the close of the year, such as:

Cicer0‚ the Defendet of the Republic
Cicero as an Orator

A Defeuse of Catiline

A Prosecution of Catiline

For Cicero and against Caesar

For Caesar and against Cicero

Catiline, th'e Friend of the Common People
Political Parties in Rome

A Defense of the Conspirators

By co-operation with the English and history depart-
mentS, these papers and investigations may be made doubly
effective.
