sEcoND-YEAR LATIN 79· .

Sometimes strong classes will complete the four books
a month or six weeks before the close of the year, although
this seldom happens. .Such classes will enjoy some light ’
reading, as the parts of Fabulae Faciles and similar Latin
with which they are not familiar.

A good plan is to give short lessons for the first two
quarters or two· thirds of the school year, to get the forms
and sentences carefully, then *to read rapidly‚ mainly at
sight, the part of the four books not already covered.
Chapters read thus at sight should be re-read next day.

The class at recitation.—

ι. Α5 the class assembleS, it is not a bad plan to have
some Latin song or hymn or memory verse with which
to take up the first minute or so. If the pupils are weak
in formS, they might repeat together the declension of

some noun or the conjugation of some verb.
⁵ 2. Questions on the previous day' s work should be
called for. Pupils sometimes find difficulties after leaving
claSS‚ on which they need help.

3. Read the review lesSon, that is, the lesson of the
previous day. If the pupil called on hesitateS, pass on to
someone else, aS this last reading ought to be done
accurately and freely.

R.ead the day' S lesson. Call on some one or two to
read the lesson through rapidly—read, not pronounce.
Ask for criticisms. After all questions are cleared up,
you might read and then have all the members of the class
read together. For a week or so you should lead the read-
ing, but gradually leave this altogether to the class. You
will be surprised to see how readily all the pupils will
learn to read through without a single mistake in pro—
nunciation.
