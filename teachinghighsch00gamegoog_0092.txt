class. Any unusually difficult words or constructions
should be explained beforehand. If the class is very
weak, translate 3 few. sentences of the next day's assign-
ment, for a month or 5ο, but discontinue this practice as
soon as possible. If the pupils have a very hard time,
you will have to stand by them and help them until
they can go alone. Perhaps they are not responsible
for being unprepared. Do not overwork nor discourage
them.

Where to begin memsam—The beginning should not

be made with the first book. This is about as difficult ·

Latin as is found in the high-school course. It is better
to begin with the second or third book. If you do this,
give the story of the books which you pass over temporarily,
so that the class will have the connection. After you
read the fourth book, you can go back and r'ead the book
or books which you passed over. It may be objected that
this plan breaks into the narrative too seriously‚ but the
narrative can stand the injury better than your class will
if you overburden the pupils with difficult constructions
at the very first.

The daily assignment.—This depends on the 51355.
The-teacher must use his good sense and try to get a fair
amount of reading done, without injustice to the pupils
or to other subjects which they are carrying.

High-school pupils are expected to read four books
of Caesar during this year and that is not too much if the
class is well prepared. But if it is impossible to do so
much, it is infinitely better to read three books carefully
and intelligently than to skim over four, five, or six. Study

your class and have it do just what it can do well and no ·

more.
