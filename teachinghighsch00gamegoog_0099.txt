SECOND-YEAR LATIN 85

history departments you may secure the reading of books
which will be in line with the work on these papers. The ‚
English department might accept the theme as one of the
required compositionS. ·

Now and then you may find pupils who will take
opposite sides and arouse very vigorous interest, as in the
discussion of Caesar as a tyrant, of his fight with -Pompey, ·
or of his patriotism. The class will become intensely
partisan, especially if you have Fronde, Mommsen, and
Middleton's Cicero in reach. ε

Have the papers read in class at the closing meetings
of the year. The very best should be read by the pupil
at the public exercises of the school, and printed in the
school paper or some other local periodical.

Prose composition.—This question is fully discussed
elsewhere. It is generally expected now that a fair amount
of Latin writing shall be done during this year, and the
colleges expect the material to be drawn from the authors
read. The usual plan is to give one of the five weekly
recitations wholly to prose writing.

You will find the plan outlined for the English-Latin
exercise, in ¹the work of the first year, as good as any, with
modifications. T hat is, go over the lesson as a sight-
reading task and have it brought in written at the next
meeting. After the class meets and before papers are
opened‚ have the books opened and the sentences given in
Latin orally. Require all the pupils to give each sentence
in concert, after it has been given correctly by a single
pupil. Then, if blackboard space permitS, send all or
part of the pupils to the board and have them proceed as
directed in the first-year plan. You may find it necessary
to collect the papers and go over thern carefully yourself,
