3. The literature. -Classical literature has largely
fumished the models on which our own literature has been
built. Not only the general plans have come into our own
us‘esffut we have taken very largely from the ideas of classi-
cal writers and shaped them to our needs, Roman and
Q characters are constant material for simile and meta-

This classical current, welcome and refreshing, runs

Mythology in English literature.——A careful investiga-
tion' into the mythological element in a number of the
English poets has been made under the direction of Pro· ’
sessor F. J. Miller, and a numerical count of these references
has given the following results: Spenser, 6503 Byron, 4503
Shelley, 32 53 Robert Browning‚ 2 503 Tennyson, 22 53
Pope‚ 17 53 Mrs. Browning‚ 17 5; Matthew Amold, 1003.
J. G. Saxe, 100.

More critical studies of these references have been made
for a few of these writers: e.g., Randall, Sources os S penser's
Classical M ythology,· Osgood, Classical Mythology in M illam·
Root, Classical M ythology in S hakespeare; and Mustard,
Classical Echoes in T ennyson. The last volume goes beyond
the mythological element, as the title indicates. Gayley's
Classic M yths in English Literature gives a general view of
this element in our literature.

Mythology at first hand.—It may be objected that a
knowledge of mythology can be had without a study of
the classics. This is partly true, but it is proper to reply
that unfortunately very few who do not study the classics
