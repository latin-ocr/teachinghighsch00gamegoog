CHAPTER -XI .
THIRD-YEAR LATIN

The team—What was said under “Second-Year Latin''
about selecting the text, organizing the cIaSS‚ assigning
the lesson‚ and the general plan of procedure holds equally
well for this year.

The year’s work—This class is generally expected to
- read six or seven orations of Cicero, including those against
Catiline, for ArchiaS, and that on Manilian law. You may
find it well worth while to use the F ourteenth Philippic
in place of the Manilian law oration, for these reasons:
. (1) It opens up a most interesting period of Roman history,
as compared with the rather tame laudation of Pompey.
Caesar and Pompey have recently fallen, Cicero is making
his last stand, and Augustus and Antony are taking over
the rule of the world. (2) It is the last of his orations we
have and one of his greatest. As the Verres orations repre-
sent his youthful oratory‚ the Catiline and Archias his
mature manhood, so the Philippics represent the last
great effort of his life, equaling the best, if it is not itself
the very best of his oratory. (3) The Manilian law oration
is long and tediouS‚ and pupils do not find it as interesting
as the Philippics.

Some teachers prefer to read Cicero for two termS, if the
year has three, and to read the Metamorphoses of Ovid
sor the last term. Both plans are good and one is no better
than the other. A term of Ovid is a good preparation for
Vergil, but this does not more than balance the good
