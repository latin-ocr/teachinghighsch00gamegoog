viii PREFACE

volume, Latin and Greek in American Education. Those
who read this book will understand my high appreciation
of this favor.

Young Latin teachers are doing a large part· in educating
the rising generation and in upholding scholarly ideals
among the people. May this little book serve to strengthen
their hands and hearts in their good work.
