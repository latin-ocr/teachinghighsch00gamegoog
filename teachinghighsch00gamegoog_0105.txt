CHAPTER XII

FOURTH-YEAR LATIN

The text and the lessam—What has been said elsewhere
about selecting the text, organizing the cIaSS, reading at
sight and ,by hearing, etc., applies also the fourth year.

The year’s work—For many years the work ot' the
fourth year in Latin has been six books of Vergil's Aeneid,
or their equivalent. This amount of reading is generally
considered excessive, and there is strong probability that
it will be considerably reduced within a short time. Your
classes should read as much as can be done comfortably,
and no more. They should read at least four books of the
Aeneid, preferably i, ii, iii, and vi. In addition, they
should read from the other bookS, or from similar Latin,
such an amount as will profitably occupy the time of the
class.

Unless you are required to do so by some fixed course
of study, you will do your part by your class if you spend the
year with Vergil. Classes which have used selections from
Livy, Cicero's essayS‚ and similar Latin in place of Vergil
have lost heavily. Vergil has influenced the world's
literature so largely that no pupil who can read his poems
should be denied 'this privilege and pleasure.

The daily assignment.-—To begin with, your class
should not take more than 15 or 20 lines a day, which will
be enough until your pupils become accustomed to Latin
poetry. If they have already read some selections from·
Ovid, this limit may be removed shortly. By the end of
the second month, 30 lines will be reasonable, and the year's
