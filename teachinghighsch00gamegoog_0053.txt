 

THE TEACHER AND HIS SUBJECT 39

are looking toward teaching as a life-work may safely ·
prepare themselves for teaching this subject, provided they
have the qualifications which have been mentioned as
furnishing a basis for Latin teaching. The young teacher ’
who takes Latin as his main subject should also prepare
himself to teach one other subject that may readily be
related to Latin, such as German, or F rench, or history
or· possibly English, according to his preferenceS. As
stated above, many high schools require a teacher to take
more than one branch of learning, and such a ccmbination
will prove a safe investment of money and of strength.

Push the· Latin, but be fair.——-Circumstances of late
years have made it ahnost necessary for the young Latin
teacher to push his work rather vigorously, in order to
prevent unfair discrimination. This is not true of all h'igh
schooIS, but of those in some sections only. The Latin
teacher must see that the work for which he is responsible
does not suffer, but there is danger that in his efforts he
may become rather intolerant toward other subjects,
especially toward those whose supporters frequently
declaim against Latin study. He must be on his guard
against this narrowness, for he might prove little better than
the faddist, of whom nothing but intolerance and narrow-
ness need be expected. The· Latin teacher must do high-
grade work in his own department and ¹see to it that his
pupils get the best that is in him3 but he must be fair to
all other subjects and to the teachers of these, and must
show just appreciation of the work done in all the other
departments. Latin cannot do the whole work of educa-
tion; it must stand shoulder to shoulder with every other
subject which can be used in the task of educating young
men and young women.
