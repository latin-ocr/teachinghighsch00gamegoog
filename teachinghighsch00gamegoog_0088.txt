CHAPTER X

SECOND-YEAR LATIN

Selecting the text.—In selecting the text for this year,
'the first question to decide is whether the class shall go
directly to Caesar or spend some time on simpler Latin
and then go to Caesar. Some good schools take up Caesar
immediately, as they seem able to prepare for Caesar in
one year. An increasingly large number of schools are
inclining toward giving the first part of this year to reading
. simple Latin as a preparation for Caesar during the
remainder of the year.

1. If -the class is ready for Caesar, a whole year can be
spent on his Gallie Wars with profit, as there is, nothing
better for training pupils in the forms and simpler con-
structions. The narrative may also be made interesting
by a good teacher, although some pupils may not enjoy
so much of battle and strife.

The teacher or committee selecting the text should
require good mechanical work, clean, clear type, and liberal
illustration. Beyond this, Caesar texts are generally
much alike, especially in notes and vocabulary—sometimes

amazingly alike. The arrangement of the material may ’

be better in some than in otherS, as some editions ha've the
notes and current vocabulary on the same page with the
text. Some few editions give the text, noteS, vocabulary,
grammar and prose composition all in one volume. This is
by no means a bad plan, and is likely to become general,
as it should. There are weak places in the editions of this
