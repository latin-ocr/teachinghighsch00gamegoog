2 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

educational system. This is especially true of Latin
because there seems to be a mistaken idea of what can
fairly be expected of Latin in the schools. Now and then
an extremist seems to blame Latin for not doing all those
things which are expected of all the high-school subjects
combined. In rare instances a warm defender of Latin
takes about the same point of view and claims credit for
all that is accomplished. Neither position is correct or
reasonable. ·

Many of those who from experience know the possi-

· bilities of Latin are persuaded that a well-trained teacher

can reach more phases of a young man's education by using
Latin than by using any other single subject. This may
well be the attitude of every teacher toward his subject,
but he must be careful not to undervalue the work of other
teacherS, or to claim as his own results which he is only a

sharer in securing. Latin has a certain rather definite ·

part in our educational scheme, and it behooves the faithful
teacher to know what he is expected to accomplish and to
see, first of all, that his energies are' exerted in that direction. .

In indicating the ends which we may reasonably expect
to attain in teaching Latin, it seems a 'satisfactory plan
to give the statements prepared by men who have all the
facts well in hand.
