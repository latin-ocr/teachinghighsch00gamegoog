It is unfortunate that several of the most scholarly
editions available are so very large and. contain 50 ve'ry

This apparent padding is valuable for reference purposes
in schools which have no library facilities. Large volumes
will necessarily go out of use as others serving the same
purpose but of convenient size become available.

A popular text in the schools of England contains only
one book of Caesar per volume. It is of convenient size‚

before very long.

The book selected should also give the story of the
books which your class cannot read. Too many pupils

but do not know the full story of the campaigns in Gaul.
If the entire story of the eight books 15 given, this plan
will prove very acceptable.

It is not at all necessary that all the pupils use the
same text, unless you are using one of the editions which
contain the text, 110105, grammar, etc.‚ in one volume.

text they may have while preparing the lesson, provided
you have a sufficient number 01501110 one text edition
for class use. Different books will naturally'take differ-
ent views of constructions now and then. Let the pupils
defend their authors, A boy will fight to the last ditch
for a book which he has been doing his best to lose or give
away.
