give the time and effort necessary for obtaining a knowledge
of mythology. Even when time and effort are expended,
the results obtained from such a study of mythology out
of its natural setting are rudimentary and of comparatively
little service. DictionarieS, encyclopediaS, andhandbooks
of mythology are of easy acceSS‚ but generally they are not
used by those who are reading an English author for the

pleasure of the reading. Suppose, however, that such a -

reader should find a reference to some character in mythol-
ogy and should open his encyclopedia. Take a reference
to Juno, for instance. He would see her described as “one
of the goddesses of the RomanS, identical with Hera of the
' GreekS, wife and sister of Jupiter,'' with possibly something
more in the same strain. The reader returns to his book
and takes up the thread of his narrative with this vague
idea of Juno in mind. But one who has followed Juno
through the Iliad of Homer and the Aeneid of Vergil has
another kind of idea of what JunorepresentS, and he reads
with this knowledge and gets vastly more out of his reading
than¹ the one who knows nothing more than what he gets
from his book of reference. The student of the classics
is able to enter into the full thought of the writer, and he
thus really enjoys the larger world which th'e other reader
never enters. ’

What has been said of mythological references in
particular holds of classical references in general throughout
English literature. No writer who knows the history, life,
- and literature of the ancients can fail to make use, now and
then at least, of the rich illustrative materials so abundantly
at hand.

The value of such a knowledge of classical matters is
readily seen by reverting to the two readers referred to
