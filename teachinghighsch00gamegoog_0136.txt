Ι 2 2 TEACHIN G HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

will practically kill any subject he may teach, no matter
what it is.

2. Join one of the classical associations referred to
elsewhere and get into touch‘ with what the live teachers
are doing in other schools. This duty of every Latin
teacher is well-nigh imperative. The writer knows per-
sonally a large number of young Latin teacherS, and he
gives it as his testimony that he does not know a single one
’ who belongs to one of these associations and reads the
Classical Journal or Classical Weekly who is not succeeding
in his work as a teacher. You greatly need the help that
these associations and these joumals will give you‚

.3. Elsewhere a play is suggested. One of the following
may prove interesting: (1) Two Latin Plays for Higlz
School Suadeam, by Susan Paxson (Ginn δι Co.); (2) Easy
Latin Plays (George Bell δι SonS, London); (3) Classical
Stories Dramatized sor School U se, by L. O. Lennart (Enter-
tainment Publishing Co.); (4) Two Dramatizalions from
Vergil, by Professor F. J. Miller (The Un’iversity of Chicago
Press); (5) Latin Plays‚ by Professor J. J. Schleicher
(Ginn δι Co,).

4. F orm a Latin club‚ and now and then get you'r pupils
together for combined business and social purposes. Try
to have an invited guest on each such evening to address
the cluh, briefiy and pointedly, stressing some phase of
classical study. Pupils themselves will sometimes prepare
paperS‚ as a result of an investigation which you can
direct. · '

5. Send for Classical, M ediaeval and. Modern Latin
Songs‚ with Music, by Calvin S. Brown (Putnam)‚ and get
your whole neighborhood to singing Latin songS. Select
one or two of the best and teach them to your classes,
