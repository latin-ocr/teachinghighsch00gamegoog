THE TEXT: ITS AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER

Who should write the 'text ?—Discussion of this ques-

It is useless to try to fix any rule in this matter. The
worth of a text depends upon the man and his adaptability

he holds. Some college professors have prepared good
high-school texts and others have prepared very poor ones,
High-school teachers likewise have records of failure and

The actual working success of a text, apart from success
due to the activity of its publisherS, must depend upon the
training and experience of the editor and his ability to
adapt his work to the needs of the classes which use the
book. Naturally we look to the men who have taught
Latin successfully as the makers of Latin textS, but we are
just as likely to be disappointed here as elsewhere. Even
when the plan is good and is well worked out, the question
of scholarship may prove a book's undoing.

In view of the large number of Latin texts available—
especially for‘ first-year classes—the great majority of
which have had no success of consequence, the teacher who

a text that can be depended upon for both scholarship and
