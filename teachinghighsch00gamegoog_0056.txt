42 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

01 1115 work with his classes he may be able to do reasonable
justice to his pupils and to his subject. He may acquire
this skill as a result 01 practicing upon his classes until he
has his resources well in hand. . A much better way would
be 101· him to make a study 01 the problems connected >with
teaching Latin——in this case, under the direction 01 0110
who is both a successful teacher and an accomplished
scholar. The young teacher who has “a knowledge 01 the
subject'' and “skill in momentary adaptation‚'' along with
others not 11011 50 fortunate, will profit greatly by such
training. There is no reason 101· fearing that this plan
will prove anything but helpful. Ι1 the young teacher is
naturally conservative, he will at least have good models
to follow instead 01 the poor ones 01 1115 own high-school
years; 11 110 15 naturally progressive, what he learns will
not hamper him nor prevent his improving on* what his
instructor has taught him. .
Better teaching a necessity.-——The stronger private
schools and the high schools 01 the larger cities are fortunate
in being able generally to secure good teachers 101· 011 their
subjects. The problem is to find strong, well-equipped
teachers for Latin in the weaker high schOOIS, many 01
which pay reasonable salaries but 01 course salaries not
equal to those paid in the cities. These 50110015, however,
have more than 11011 the pupils who are studying high-school
brancheS‚ and other subjects besides Latin are poorly
taught. It is probable that Latin is as well taught as any
thing'else in the majority 01 these institutions; but when
Latin is poorly taught, or is in the hands 01 an incom-
petent teacher, its burden is increased, and faults appear

which in fact do not belong to Latin, as has been said
elsewhere. “
