36 TEACHIN G HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

Many young people are blessed with what teachers
like to call “the language sense,'' “a feeling for language,''
which may mean that they naturally think quickly and
connectedly and have a memory which retains readily and
permanently. Young teachers who have this advantage,
and with it a “ genius for hard work,'' have the natural quali-
fications which make the successful teacher of Latin.
Many who are only moderately endowed in these particulars
achieve great things as teacherS, by vigorous effort and
close application—a fact which offers encouragement to
those who are willing to pay the price in persistent
endeavor.

The study of Latin and· other foreign languages will
prove helpful to those who are slow in language work, but
if such students ever turn to teachjng they should seek
subjects which more readily adapt themselves to their own
mental aptitude. They may have some strength in close
and careful reasoning, in industrious pursuit of details, in

manual deiterity, and these qualities may possibly be‘

turned to good account in teaching one or more of the
sciences. However, it is safe to say that a slow student
should not be encouraged to think that the world needs his
services in the capacity of a teacher.

Hard work will achieve wonderS, especially if there 'is a
strong personality back of the effort. To achieve the best
resultS, the teacher must be happy in his work. To be
happy, he must have the subject which suits him best,
which fits in best with his natural inclination and thus calls
out the best that is in him. . For one who likes Latin as a
subject, and likes to teach it, likes to use it as an educational
instrument, nothing else can quite take its place or so com-
pletely occupy his “mind, soul, and strength.''
