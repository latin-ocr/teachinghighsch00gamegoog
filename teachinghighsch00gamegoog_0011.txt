PREFACE

This little book represents a revision and enlargement
of the H andbook sor H igh-School T eachers os Latin which
was published as a bulletin of the Missouri State Normal
School, Cape Girardeau, in 1907, while the writer was ,
connected with that institution as professor of Latin and
Greek. That bulletin had a surprising popularity. An
edition of five thousand was distributed within a short
time, mainly in response to requests from all parts of the
country'. Even after a lapse of more than eight yearS, calls
for copies are frequently received.

An eamest effort has been made to prepare a practical
manual that will meet some of the immediate needs of the
young teacher of Latin. The plans proposed represent
actual experience in the high school, the normal school,
and the college. They have been tested thoroughly and
found effective. They do not represent a final solution of
all the problems of the young teacher, but they do represent
the best contribution the writer can now make to the cause
of better teaching 1n our schools. â€œ

Some of the suggestions here given were made originally
by Professor C. U. Clark, director of the American Acad-
emy, Rome, Italy. My obligation to him is very great.
Professors G. J. Laing and F. J. Miller, of the University
of ChicagO, did me the kindness to read the manuscript
and make suggestions which have added very much to the
value of the book. Their help is fully appreciated.

Professor Francis W. Kelsey, of the University of Michi-
' gan, gave me permission to use quotations from his excellent
