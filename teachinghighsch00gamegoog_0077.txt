FIRST-YEAR LATIN 63

those of long experience, who may now and then get an
idea that will help them.

A general suggestion.—1n the first place, it is necessary ⁴

to call attention to the fact that in your beginning Latin
classes you are giving many students their first taste of real,

hard study. It will require much patience and common· -

sense to keep them really interested and disposed to stick
to their task. When they complain, some students who
are taking other subjects which require little application
or study will give glowing reports of their easy times and
thus unsettl'e the minds of your young Romans. Stay
close to them individually and try to set right any who
are being disquieted by the sight of others· disporting
themselves under less irksome conditions. You have the
hard task of teaching a dozen things in one class. Few of
your beginning students know anything whatever about
English grammar. Many do not know a subject from a
predicate. Teachers of English are very busy nowadays
with the beauties of literature—and you must with patience
do a part of their work in your Latin class Some students
will know nothing about concentration, nothing about
doing a neat, careful, painstaking piece of‘ work of any
kind, and you must teach them these things. Hold them
to every form with the utmost exactneSS. Explain to
them meantime just wherein they are weak and let them
know th'at much of their difficulty is due to the fact that
they must learn a number of other things along with their'
Latin. Tell them of the benefits which have ‘come to the
countless thousands who have learned Latin, and do not
hesitate to let them feel that the boy who chooses Latin
and makes good in it is a superior student in your estimation
and one whom lazier and duller boys might profitably
