LATIN'S SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE 13

they did with Latin as their instrument. And Latin is
just as readily available today as it ever was,

It is submitted then that much of the firmness of the
public's hold upon the classics is due to a fixed belief that
in some way these subjects have a decided bearing upon
the developing of character in the young. The charge that
Latin is not a practical subject has been waived in favor of
the consideration that it does a larger service in enabling
the student to store up in mind and heart those permanent
resources which come forth as from a never-failing store-
house when their master has need. So long as Latin
study continues to contributeso largely to human society,
men and women will call forits help in making citizens and
noble characterS.

The immediate and the larger service.—In the state-
ments given in the previous chapter, which bore more
directly upon the immediate work of the Latin teacher,
it was noticed that the larger service loomed up high even
by the very side of the more immediate; that those whose
,statements were quoted invariably led up to or pointed to
the larger service of Latin study aS, after all, quite as
important as the smaller and more immediate. In other
wordS, the immediate was apparently regarded as a door-
way to the larger and more vital. The educator who recog-
nizes the fact that education amounts to nothing except
as it develops the larger phases of human character and
makes for the sum of human betterment has indeed found
the secret of real service. Very generally Latin is credited
with effectiveness in the hands of such educatorS. Perhaps
the best way to bring out this larger service, as coupled with
and following the more immediate, is to present the evidence
of men who are recognized as competent witnesses.
