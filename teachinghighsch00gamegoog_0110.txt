LATIN PROSE COMPOSITION

Latin writing generally required.—The value of writ-
ing Latin as a means to an accurate knowledge of the forms

- and sentence structure of the language is generally> recog-

nized. Most of the high schools give one hour of recitation
each week to this exercise‚ in addition to the time required
for preparation out of class. The common plan is to assign
a lesson from a prose composition text and to require the
written work to be brought in for the' teacher’s 'inspection.

Results unsatisfactory.—The results which have come
from Latin writing are generally poor and ‘out of keeping
with the- time and'energy expended. Few pupils can write ·
simple Latin correctly at the time of their graduation‚ and
it is doubtful whether we should expect them to do so‚
Men who have done work in advanced Latin are not neces-
sarily accurate in this exerci'se. Certainly the results are
very unsatisfactory. We are at fault somewhere—in our
purpose, or in the plan followed.

Trouble “based on Caesar‚” in pam—For one thing,
the books commonly used are partly responsible for our ’
failure. In those “based on Caesar'' and “based on
Cicero,'' there is generally a lack of gradation. The first
sentences may be quite as difficult as those farther on, or
even in the last part of the book. Thesebooks lack a simple
starting-point sor the beginner. They take entirely too
much for granted and overburden the student from the first.

Some relies for this trouble would come from selecting
a text which takes up one simple principle of syntax and
