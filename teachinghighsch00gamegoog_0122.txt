CHAPTER XV

CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT FOR THE LATIN DEPARTMENT

Teachers' of Latin have not generally urged upon the
school authorities their need of classroom equipment and
consequently this has received little attention. It is quite
as important for the Latin teacher to have a modern equip-
ment for his work as it is for the teacher of any subject
in the course of study.

For a long time teachers of science were unable to secure
any laboratory facilities‚ but a better day has dawned for

the sciences. It is now comparatively easy for science '

teachers to convince the school authorities of their need of
laboratory materiaIS, and this is very fortunate. The
Latin teacher, alsO, must press his needs upon the attention
of his school board. without proper equipment‚ he can-
not hope to do his best work nor get· the most satisfactory
results,

Some needs of the Latin room: ·

1. Charts.-—The Latin classroom should have the
following wall maps: Ancient Italy, Ancient Gaul, Ancient
Rome, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire. Either the
“ Kiepert Classical Series'' or 'the “Kampen Classical
Series'' will prove satisfactory, although the latter are
preferable. Buy your charts mounted on spring rollers
and boxed. ¹ ’

2. Books.—-

a) General, sor the class.—

Necessary: Lewis, Latin Dictionary; Smith, English—
Latin Dictionary,· Harper, Classical Dictionary; Platner,
