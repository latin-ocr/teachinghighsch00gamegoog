able years, He is to gain discipline, he is to win mastery over him-
self, to learn to use his intellectual powers ; but if he can attain these
necessary ends and at the same time be adding vastly to his spiritual
resources, to the comfort of his soul, to the joy of his true .life in the
years to come, when ‘the cares and responsibilities and distractions
of professione] and business activity shall absorb his time and energy,
should not those subjects for study be preferred which shall enable
him most easily to bring about these most desirable results? Let
us never long leave out of our thought that life is not mere getting
and spending, mere sowing and reaping‚ mere material succeSS‚ of
whatever form. That is only the basis for something better and
higher and more enduring.

And so, especially for the young man that hopes to be a leader
in the professional and business life of the time, in finance and affairs
of state—-in practical life, in a word—those studies are to be preferred
which shall make him more a man, give him a wider outlook, a larger
prospect of life, quicken his power of vision, enlarge his range of
sympathy and appreciation, and bring him into the fullest consciousq
ness of the sources and development of the culture we enjoy .....
It makes a man more a man, the more he knows of what men afore-
time have borne and done and thought. The most practical man,
in the final survey of human life, is the one who puts the emphasis on
man and not on practicam who is never too absorbed in the cares
and triumphs of life to ask himself soberly now and then: “What
‘shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own
soul ?''
