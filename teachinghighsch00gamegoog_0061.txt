ENGLISH IN LATIN STUDY

English largely Latin.—The English language has
drawn so largely upon Latin as a source of words and of
ideas that no sane person can fail to see the large possibilities
in the study of Latin for those who speak English. In

reasons for retaining Latin ‚in our schools. English
teachers have found that pupils who have had Latin are not

had it, but that year in and year out they make decidedly
higher grades 1n English.1
