70 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

Very much written work in the first year has often
proved a nuisance rather than a help. If your text has
more than four short sentenceS, do not assign more than
four to be reported in writing. After the first half-year,

pupils well when they take up a modern language.
However, do not be too rigid in this matter. Be sure
that you pronounce correctly yourself‚ and the pupils will
