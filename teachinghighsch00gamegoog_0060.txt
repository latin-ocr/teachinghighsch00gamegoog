46 TEACHING HIGH-scnooL LATIN

These are merely suggestions as to some things which
may be made the basis of investigation during the course
and have the advantage of a successful test.

Seli-trained tenchers.—-A large majority of our Latin
teachers decided upon Latin teaching after they finished
their college course, or else did their work in a coUege which
offered no opportunity to take a. course preparatory to
Latin teaching. Such teachers can do much to supplement
their own efforts and experience by summer courses in the
universities‚ and by closely studying the various books and
bulletins available on the subject of better Latin teaching.
A list of some of the best books of this character is given

elsewhere.
