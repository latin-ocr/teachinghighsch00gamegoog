LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIF E 11

study and to attribute to it much of their own success in
lise. · This is and has been a stone wall against which the
charges of anti-Latinists have fallen- flat. Hundreds who
are recognized as the strong men of the nation have given
evidence as to the value derived in their own lives from the
study of Greek and Latin, but have said very little of other
subjectS.

The⁴ evidence of great men is conclusive.—-It is the
meraet folly to undertake to set aside the emphatic evidence
os statesmen‚ business men, bankerS, lawyerS‚ physicianS‚
ministers, engineerS, scientistS, and others in large numberS,
such 'as was given at the classical conferences held at the
University of Michigan. Among these witnesses were such' ,
men as DrS. Vaughan, De Nancrede, and Hinsdale of the
university medical faculty3 Professors Saddler, Patterson‚
Williams‚ and Davis of the engineering faculty; Mr.
Merritt Starr and Mr. Lyndon Evans of the Chicago bar3
Dean Hutchens of the university law faculty3 Hon.
Harlow P. Davock‚ Hon. Levi I. Barbour, and Hon.
Hinton E. Spalding of the Detroit bar3 Hon. James Eryce,
then ambassador from Great Britain; Hon. John W. Foster,
Hon. James Brown Scott·‚ and Dr. Harvey W. Wiley of
Washington; and Mr. Charles Williams of Indianapolis.
All these, and others in goodly numberS, were outspoken
in their support of the classics, and nearly every one of the
speakers recognized the service which had been rendered
to himself.

Recent testimony from President Wilson, Ex-President
Tast, Hon. John D. Long, Dr. Lyman Abbott, Mr. S. S.
McClure, Mr. C. P. SteinmetZ, and otherS, is familiar to
those who regularly read the Classical Weekly and the
Classical Journal.
