86 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

but the labor required in this is so great that it cannot be
advised or urged, except in cases where common-sense
judges it necessary.

As to marking the voweIS, use your own judgment.

The writer's opinion was given under “Quantity.'' If
you require long vowels marked, give very, very short
Iessons. ’ ·
’ If you are free to try another plan, in place of giving
one day a week to prose writing, follow that given under
the general discussion. Good experience has proved the
value of the plan by which at the close of the day’s transla-
tion two or three sentences are given out by the teacher,
preferably only two. Put these on the board, or use the
sentences in the text. Go over them at sight and call for
these written out as part of the next day's work. Take
these up, or, better, grade them as suggested before,
allowing pupils to exchange. Send some or all of the pupils
to the board. This will take only five minutes each day,
and will save you a full recitation each week for reading
purposeS.

This plan is better than the full-day arrangement.
Pupils watch ‚for similar constructions and expressions in
their reading. Ask pupils to offer sentences for the next
day, based on the lesson, if you prefer. You can modiiy
those offered so that they will do. Stick fast to two sen-
tenceS‚ and short ones at that. A really workable text
could give one or two sentences after each chapter.

Break away from the reading now and then and give
other sentences, as a relies frorn the monotony. Use a
newspaper paragraph, or a story now and then, as a source
for the sentences.
