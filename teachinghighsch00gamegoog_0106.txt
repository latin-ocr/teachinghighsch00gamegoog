92 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

daily maximum of 40 lines ought to be within the reach
of the class· by the end of the fourth month. These are

feet properly divided. By the end of the second month,
require each pupil to scan the lines to be read. Gradually
require the class to scan the day's lesson in concert, scan-

you. They will become 5ο very proficient that they will

made shorter.

Outside reading.--During the year, each pupil should
