116 TEACHING HIGH·SCHOOL LATIN

credit for new passages which will be assigned from parts
of the book not read in class. For this let the pupils have
the vocabulary just as when preparing the lesson at home.
They ought to know that translations will fail them in a
test like that, and that the sensible course for them is to
do their own work as they go along and to learn how to do
any task assigned them.

4. Assign lessons which can be done within a reasonable
