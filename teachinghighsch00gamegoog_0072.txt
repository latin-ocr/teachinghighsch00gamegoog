58 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN

Latin texts, Just why this number was decided upon, or
why it has been so generally followed, is difficult to ex-
plain, and even more difficult to establish as pedagogically
sound. ·

The texts are understood to contain a year's work,
divided into 75 “Iessons'' By most teacherS, a “lesson''
is understood to be a day 's task. Calling the divisions
“ chapterS,'' as a few texts do, does not change the fact that
the “lesson'' idea is eonveyed to' the young teacher.

It is highly improbable that any class of pupils of
secondary grade could, day in and day out, master these
“Iessons'' as they are given. The editors do not expect·
it, as is seen in the titleS, F irst-Year Latin, F irst Latin
Book, Latin sor‘Beginners, and so on. Now inasmuch as

“ pupils confessedly cannot do the “lessons '' as given, and

the editors do not expect anything of the kind, the question
of the wisdom and the pedagogical soundness of the plan
is not a very difficult one to dispose of.

An experienced teacher might be able to divide the
material given in the ordinary first Latin text of 75 lessons
so as to keep well in hand the year's task, and finally
complete his work satisfactorily. A large number are
forced to guess their whereabouts the first year they use a
text. If they come out well, they watch for the dates which
they were careful to make against certain stopping-placeS,
as charts for succeeding years. But an inexperienced
teacher, seeing the word “ lesson,'’ may try to force a lesson
on his claSS‚ from the first. If not, he is entirely at sea as
to where he is going and when he is expected to arrive.
Scores of young teachers' have told the writer that this divi-
sion of the text into impossible lessons had been the ‚bane
of their lives while they were trying to teach Latin. Why ’
