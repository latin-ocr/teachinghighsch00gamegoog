FOURTH-YEAR LATIN 93

ginians. If possible, Benjamin's Troy should be read also.
Try to make arrangements with the English department by
which your pupils may read translations of Homer's Iliad
and Odyssey and Dante's Divina Commedia as partos the
required reading. -If you can find time for fiction, let your
class read some of the following: Flaubert's SalammbO,
the M aid os Carthage, Henry’s- A Young Carthaginian,
Gallazier's S orceress os Rome, Sienkiewicz' Quo Vadis, and
some of Crawford's storieS, as C ecili'a, H cart os Rome,
Saracinesca, Lady os Rome.

A class playn—If the class is large enough, oris material
from other sources is available, you will get good results
from 'a play based on the reading of Vergil. Miller's
Two Dramatizations from Vergil is good, but it will be-
necessary to cut out a great deal that is given, as there is
entirely too much for one person to commit to memory
without neglecting other work. Good results may be ’
obtained by reading this play to the class as time permits.

The yearly theme.-Follow the plan of the other years
and require a yearly essay based on some phase of the study
-os the Aeneid. Themes on subjects like these will be
helpful:

Nature in the Aeneid
Vergil's Similes and Metaphors
The Women os Vergil
Excavations at Troy
Excavations at Mycenae and Tiryns
Omens and Oracles in the Aeneid
The Geography of the Aeneid
Birds and Animals in the Aeneid

·- Visions and Dreams in the Aeneid
Milton's Debt to Vergil
Dante’s Debt to Vergil
