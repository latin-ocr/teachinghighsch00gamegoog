QUESTION S, ANSWERS AND SUGGESTIONS 119

2. Latin is the basis of all the Romance languageS‚
French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, etc. One cannot
thoroughly understand these languages without a knowl-
edge of Latin; and a pupil who does know Latin can learn
them in half the time required by the non-Latin student
to get a smattering.

3. Our civilization is largely derived from the Roman,
including our laWS, politica] customS‚ religion, and even our
everyday customs. F ew realize the extent of our obliga-

tion to the Romans. Not only have we taken over these ,

,laws‚ etc., but the very words by which we name them are
- of Latin origin.

4. Latin has for centuries been a factor in our education.
It could not have held its place 'if it had not been effective
as an instrument in making educated men and women.
Substitutes now being tried have so far failed utterly as
regards the type of scholar turned out.

5. The world's laWS, politics, customS, and education
have been largely based on those developed in Rome, even
as the highest type of religion spread from the Eternal City.

What can 1 do about this “vocation’' business ?—There

· is a great deal of common-sense back of the general demand

for training that will help in making a living. Young
people should grow up with the fact before them that they
will some day be expected to do their part as men and
women. Those who study Latin should know how to earn
a livelihood, and those who put their whole thought upon
making the livelihood would be better off if they also studied
Latin. Latin teachers, therefore, are as much interested

in vocational training as anybody else, and they should give .

it due encouragement.
